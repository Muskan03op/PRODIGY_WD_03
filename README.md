This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as a task for the Prodigy Infotech Web Development Internship. It is created using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. The game is designed for two players to take alternate turns on the same device, aiming to get three markers in a row to win. It features an attractive user interface with a vibrant gradient background, interactive hover effects, and smooth transitions. The application also includes sound effectsâ€”a click sound when a cell is filled and a winning bell sound to celebrate victory. When a player wins, the winning cells are highlighted in green, and a status message displays the winner. In case of a draw, an appropriate message is shown. Users can easily restart the game using a button at the bottom. The entire game logic, UI styling, and sound handling are implemented internally within a single HTML file, making it simple to run and easy to share. To play the game, simply open the tic-tac-toe.html file in any modern web browser. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my ability to build fully functional, visually appealing, and interactive web applications from scratch.
